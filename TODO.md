## TODO/Further Enhancements
(in no particular order)

- Support markdown
- Reusing/referencing code blocks from other code blocks.
- Other languages?
- ~~Expanding/Collapsing code blocks.~~
- ~~create CSS, at least for the basic "inline"~~
- supporting re-evaluation of blocks, on demand
- supporting hidden code blocks (with "hide" class?)
- ~~support named code blocks, showing names in the document~~
- decouple the styles from the code using them
- ~~reporting errors in literate code block properly~~
  - Allow for more control of how errors are reported (maybe a custom panel/fixture?)
- Add the option to see the imported/used scripts in the file. To (optionally) nicely show references
