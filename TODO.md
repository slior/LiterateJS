## TODO/Further Enhancements
(in no particular order)

- Support markdown
- ~~Reusing/referencing code blocks from other code blocks.~~
- Other languages?
- ~~Expanding/Collapsing code blocks.~~
- ~~create CSS, at least for the basic "inline"~~
- supporting re-evaluation of blocks, on demand
- ~~support named code blocks, showing names in the document~~
- decouple the styles from the code using them
- ~~reporting errors in literate code block properly~~
  - ~~Allow for more control of how errors are reported (maybe a custom panel/fixture?)~~
- Add the option to see the imported/used scripts in the file. To (optionally) nicely show references
- Utility functions
  - ~~Displaying tabular data easily~~
  - allow highlighting inputs from the code it is used in
- Add interaction with other input types
- add some notion/option for reuse of pages
  - entails some notion of namespaces.
- adding support for integrating unit tests nicely.
- Document extension points
- for extensions: add the option to fallback to previous/default behavior
- extensions:
  - ~~specify a specific extension for a specific element (e.g. drawing results)~~
  - hook for before/after block execution
- ~~allow true out-of-order execution. code blocks should be able to easily reference other code blocks.~~
- ~~tooltips for inline block should show the code used for calculating it.~~
- allow integration with external code
- literate code templates.
- add the option to easily show/hide hidden code blocks
- for collapsed code block - tooltip that shows the code.
- ~~for inline code block, after evaluation - have an option to show underlying code, e.g. using a tooltip, or by clicking on it.~~
